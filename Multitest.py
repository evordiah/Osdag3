'''
Only difference between Unitest.py and Multitest.py file is Multitest uses for loop to run each file
whereas unitest has a unique function for each file.

Now if we have fixed number of test files it's better to use Unitest if we want to find out which file
is failing the test case. It'll show  name of the function which is failing the test case and from there
we can traceback the filename(coz we know which function is running which input file).

But using Multitest we can't traceback which file is failing coz it's running in for loop. It'll just show
the number of test cases failed and passed.

            In save_design function second argument is popup summary which user gives as an input.
            For testing purpose we are giving some default values for creating every pdf.
            We are actually not comparing pdf. This is just for testing purpose whether function
            is running fine and creating pdf or not.

            I have made some changes in save_design function. Instead of asking for output file
            location from save_design function it'll ask from 'save_inputSummary' function inside
            ui_summary_popup.py file immediately after getting popup inputs and send it to
            save_design function using the same dictionary in which popup inputs are present
